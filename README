COMPILE AND INSTALL

Simplest way to complie and install would just:

./configure && make

then

sudo make install

the generated binary will be install to /usr/local/bamboo directory,
the library will be install to /usr/local/lib directory. So check
your ldconfig setting and your build script accordingly.
